# minutex

A Latex template for minutes documents for FHNW student projects.

## Getting Started

This repository provides the following files:

* **`minutes.cls`**: The template itself
* **`images/HSW_Student-Project.png`**: The student project logo used by the template
* **`example.tex`**: An example document using the template

The template and the `.tex`-file have to be in the same directory (as well as the `images` directory). Open `example.tex` to get comfortable with using it - it provides very basic support for how to use it.

The Latex Workshop extension automatically (re-)generates the PDF file when the `.tex`-file is saved.

## VS Code Recommendations

The extensions below are recommended when using VS Code. Upon opening VS Code, the user should be asked if they should be installed/enabled for the present workspace.
